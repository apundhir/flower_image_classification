# Flower image classification

We will see how to model deep learning network which can classify flowers into “roses” and “daisies”. This is a toy dataset and its purpose is to introduce you to the key concepts and methodologies. 

Objectives:
1. How to set-up an end-to-end pipeline for training deep learning models

2. Preprocessing techniques: Morphological transformations etc.

3. Data augmentation using data generators

4. Building a network: Ablation experiments, hyperparameter tuning, storing the best model in disk etc.
